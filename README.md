# Data-Structures-
My final project for Data Structures at Simmons University 

I went above and beyond by delving into the real-world performance of priority queues. I modified provided BinaryHeap.py code to track the "work" done by functions like insert() and perc_up(). I applied the same approach to each level of code, collecting data on how well they performed. Through analysis and testing, I tackled questions about the expected Big O and compared the "work" numbers to theoretical values. I also explored how the "work" changes with input size (n) and visualized the findings in graphs. This comprehensive effort not only met the project requirements but also deepened my understanding of algorithmic efficiency.
